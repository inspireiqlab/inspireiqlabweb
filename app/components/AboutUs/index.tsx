              <p>
              As per the NEP 2020, early exposure to STEM, Robotics, and AI is crucial to preparing children for the future. At InspireIQ Lab, we believe every child is born an innovator—they just need the right environment.
              Our playful lab is packed with child-safe robots, coding puzzles, and hands-on science experiments. We don’t just teach—we spark imagination.
