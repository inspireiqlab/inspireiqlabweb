Teacher explains everything clearly, from basics to advanced, and the practice assignments after every class make it easier to learn. Now I actually enjoy learning C and feel much more confident.',

        comment: 'The C programming course was very helpful for learning the basics of coding. The teacher was really nice and explained every topic clearly, which made it easier to understand things like loops, arrays, and functions. Sir also gave us some small projects and basic games to make learning more interesting. Some parts, like pointers, were a bit tricky at first, but the teacher’s way of teaching made them easier to follow. Overall, this course gave me good knowledge and confidence to learn more programming languages.',

        comment: "I'm so impressed with InspireIQ Lab. They have completely changed my son's perspective on learning—he now sees it as an adventure. The hands-on approach to STEM and robotics is exactly what he needed to spark his interest. The focus on critical thinking and collaboration over rote learning is a breath of fresh air. Highly recommended for any parent who wants to nurture their child's inner innovator.",
