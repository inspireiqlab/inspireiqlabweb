      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        At InspireIQ Lab, we believe that curiosity is the spark that powers a child’s brightest ideas. We&apos;re building a hands-on education space where children explore <strong>STEM, Robotics, AI, and IoT</strong> through joyful play and creative problem-solving.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        InspireIQ Lab is not a course-selling platform — it’s an <strong>interactive learning ecosystem</strong>. Our programs nurture inventiveness, collaboration, and critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
        Whether it’s building a robot, designing a simple AI model, or experimenting with sensors, kids get to <strong>play with the future</strong> — guided by mentors who care more about how children think than what they memorize.
